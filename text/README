Configuration file (to read the direcotry PATH information).

You can create the file: $HOME/.config/dacco/qdacco.conf
Then you need to write:

[dacco]
directori=/usr/share/dacco-common/dictionaries

(Warning: "directori" and not "directory")

If this directory is not valid, it textdacco will try /usr/share/dacco-common/dictionaries/ .

The command line option (--basepath) is the most priority one.
