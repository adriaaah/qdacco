## What is DACCO?
DACCO stands for "Diccionari Anglès-Català de Codi Obert" or "English-Catalan Open Source Dictionari". This project was very active around 2000 to 2010 and then it lost the activity.

The last known DACCO version (0.9) has more than 20.000 entries from English to Catalan and from Catalan to English. This makes it useful for everyone.
